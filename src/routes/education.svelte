                    have created productions like Atrapando infieles, Entrevistamos A, Mansión del influencer and 
                    Exponiendo infieles, the latter being their most popular. They have also had people like Alex 
                    Flores, Daniel Alfaro, and Lizbeth Rodríguez as employees. In the video YouTube Rewind 2019: For 
                    the Record, 2019 edition of YouTube Rewind, Badabun was listed as the most popular Spanish-language 
                    channel. Their popularity increased in early 2020 for cheating a Super Mario Bros speedrun and passing 
                    it off as their own in Pasando Super Mario Bros. En 5 minutos.
